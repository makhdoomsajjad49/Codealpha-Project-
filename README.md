Task 2 
Phishing Awareness Training 

To wrap up this phishing awareness module, it's clear that phishing remains one of the most prevalent and deceptive cyber threats, relying on social engineering to exploit human trust rather than technical flaws. By recognizing key indicators in emails, websites, and tactics like pretexting or authority impersonation, and adopting best practices such as verifying sources, enabling 2FA, and reporting suspicions, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce risks. Real-world examples, from massive corporate breaches like Colonial Pipeline to everyday scams, highlight the costly consequences of complacency. Ultimately, ongoing education, vigilance, and a skeptical mindset form the strongest shield against these attacks—stay informed, practice regularly, and consult security experts to safeguard your digital world.
